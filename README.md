## Basics & Thinking

**the notes and analysis of model are in ./docs/**

### DeepAAI

#### Basics

* DeepAII combine local feature and global feature
  * loacl: CNN, extract feature from amino feature(processed)
  * global: GCN, extract feature from graph feature
    * combine multiple inputs(based on graph structure)
    * generate adjacency matrix
    * use GCN to generate by inputing node_ft and adj 
    * output: combine node_ft in different stages

#### Thinkings

* About local feature: 
  * CNN is too simple, maybe Transformer can utilize more info 
    * 7.15--> cur: keep using CNN to keep the model simple
  * Design with antibody's bio feature 
* About global feature:
  * GCN can be replaced to GAT
  * inputs 
    * 7.15--> cur: only use kmer
  * contrastive learning: GCN and GAT


### MCGCL-DTA

#### Basic

* genarate affinity graph
* use GCN and GAT to process the graph
* contrastive learning
